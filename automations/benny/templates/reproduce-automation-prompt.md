# Reproduce automation prompt

> Source material for the copied setup workflow. Paraphrase this intent into a `/schedule` routine draft after confirming that the copied pack is committed in the repository where the routine will run.

Read and follow `.claude/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md` for this run.

Configuration source. Include this repository-relative path only when it is committed in the same target repository. Otherwise paraphrase the configured values. Never use a plugin source or cache path:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger. A scheduled run scans the configured source channel for new top-level reports and processes each one it has not already handled; skip threads that already carry this routine's repro, verification, or blocked outcome. Each processed report supplies:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

The creation intent should describe this as acting on each new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel. It should include the configured repository, default branch, issue tracker, control adapter, feature map, and draft pull request capability.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting.

Wait for a configured triage marker from the configured triage identity in this exact thread. A trusted marker already present in the thread satisfies the wait. Proceed only for `[benny:bug]` or `[benny:performance]`.

Require the configured control-adapter skill before attempting a repro. Reproduce the exact discriminating symptom twice through the real UI. Verify existing pull requests or commits without authoring over them. Attempt a bounded fix only after a confirmed repro and the operational file's fix gate.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Every child prompt must forbid `SendSlackMessage`, `PostToSlack`, `chat.postMessage`, and all other Slack writes. Children return findings only.

Never post a root message in the source channel.
